# Slightly More Awesome

Slightly More Awesome (SMA) is a daily, shareable, subject review app that will
make you slightly more awesome at a subject of your choice. SMA is a easy to use
web app that will help you review a subject in a fun and engaging way. SMA is
inspired by [Stormoji](https://stormoji.com).

Each day you are given a set of four questions in your subject and you just need
to answer them. The questions are randomly selected from a list of review questions
that have been curated for the subject. Once all four questions are answered, you
will see your results and have the option to share them with friends and family.
Up to six months of result history are saved in your browser's local storage.

The "Design notes" and "Implementation notes" sections below were used for
prompting the AI assistan (aider/claude) and are left here for reference.

## How to Play

1. Visit [slightlymoreawesome.com](https://slightlymoreawesome.com) to see your daily questions.
2. Answer your four daily questions.
3. Share your results with friends and classmates.

## Initial design and implementation notes

Initial design and implementation notes can be found in the [AINOTES.md](AINOTES.md)
file. As the name implies, these notes were used for prompting the AI assistant for
the intial draft of the project. The project has since evolved but the notes are
left here for reference.
